    description: In this work, we study the hypothesis that speaker identity embeddings extracted from speech samples may be used for detection and classification of emotion. In particular, we show that emotions can be effectively identified by learning speaker identities by use of a 1-D Triplet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) & Global Style Token (GST) scheme (e.g., DeepTalk Network) and reusing the trained speaker recognition model weights to generate features in the emotion classification domain.
